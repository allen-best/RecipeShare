# RecipeShare
RecipeShare is a group project done for CS-546 at Stevens Institute of Technology.
Our team's goal for this project was to combine a few of our interests and make a website that will allow people to post their own food and drink recipes and share them with others.
Users will be able to create an account/profile to which they can save and share any recipe of their choosing.
They can also see other user's profiles and recipes and can leave comments, likes, or ratings for the recipes if they choose to.
RecipeShare aims to rival companies like CookPad and Recipe-Keeper to become a mainstream recipe sharing, culinary go-to!
